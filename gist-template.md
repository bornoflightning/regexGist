# Matching an Email with Regex

Here is an easy way to search and match an email using Regex, an explanation on how it works and how to apply it to your code.

## Summary

When searching through data, it is impossible to know what the exact input of the user will be. Regex allows you to search based on matching criteria for patters that fit the description of an email. The following snipped allows you to sift through endless literals using meta to find your search request.

<code>/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/</code>
